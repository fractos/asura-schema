# asura-schema
A Json-Schema draft 4 validator.

Mostly. Probably covered about 75% of the specification so far.

Be warned, this is a work in progress. I'm not going at it with the goals of 100% coverage if it turns out to be a pain,
or with ideas of backwards compatibility between draft versions, or with any eye to future versions. This is just doing
what it needs to do for my purposes.
